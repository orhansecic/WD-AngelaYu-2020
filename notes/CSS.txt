Box Model:
+ Every HTML element is represented as a "box model" in the browser. It has its own elements that are mostly set by the default values of the browser.
+ Those elements can be seen here: https://prnt.sc/ratq77
+ Every box has its border, the line that is setting the outline of the box.
+ Padding the internal space of the box element.
+ Margin the outer space of the box element.

Anatomy of CSS:
body {
	background-color: red;
} 
Element that will be modified by CSS then curly brackets, inside of curly brackets you write the css code, every line ends with ;

++Very Important Attribute that is added to elements to group them together for more precise CSS implementation is "CLASS":
+ It is added as the Attribute to the HTML element in the opening tag --> class=""
+ You can have more than one class per HTML element and class names can be used on more than one HTML element
+ Multiple class names example: <p class="ovojeprvaklasa ovojedrugaklasa">
+ Class is accessed in CSS by .nameoftheclass{}

++Very Important Attribute that is added to elements for identifying them is called "id":
+ It is added as the Attribute to the HTML element in the opening tag --> id=""
+ You can only have one class per HTML element and that id name can not be used anywhere else
+ ID is accessed in CSS by #nameoftheid{}

CSS elements:
/* */ --> commenting
+ background-color: name of color; --> changes the color of the HTML element
(The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).)
+ border-style: value; --> changes the style of border of specific element, every HTML element is essentially a box with this CSS code you are changing
the style of that box. There are different values that can be set to this element.
+ border-radius
+ height: 2px; --> height of the box of the element set to 2 pixels, for an example adding 10 pixels to <hr> increases its size to 10 pixels, same as setting the 
size="10" = height: 10;
+ width: 20px --> width of the box of the element set to 20 pixels.
+ border-width: --> specifies the width of the line that is border itself
+ border-color: --> sets the color of the border
+ color: --> changing the color of a text
+ font-size: --> size of the words
+ font-family: --> changes the style of text  --------------- W3SCHOOLS - CSS web safe fonts ----- CSS font stack shows the percentage of users that have
that font so its safe to use it.
++ GOOGLE FONTS ++ -- website from where you can pick fonts and embed them to your website so you are 100% sure that everyone will see your font
as you made it.
+ text-align: centre --> centres the text

+padding
+margin
+Display: Block or Inline or Inline-Block or None; --> how an element is displayed, block means that an element has the width of the page while inline
means that elements box is around him, inline-block is best of both worlds - elements can be in a same line and you can affect the width of them.
+position: static, relative  --> static position of an HTML element is a default value which means that the HTML element will be shown on the website
in the same order the code was written, relative changes the position of an HTML element by creating the ability of an element to move freely
on the website by changing the properties (top, bottom, left, right) - 49. CSS Static and Relative Positioning
+position: absolute --> similar to relative, but it influences the position of HTML elements it does not leave a "ghost" of element where it was
50. Absolute positioning
+ position: fixed
