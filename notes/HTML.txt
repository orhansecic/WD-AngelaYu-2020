The Anatomy of an HTML tag:
Two types of tags:
1. Opening and Closing Tags - start with an opening tag <h1> content </h1> and end with a closing tag with content between them
2. Self closing tags - like <br> they do not require a closing tag

++Very Important Attribute that is added to elements to group them together for more precise CSS implementation is "CLASS":
+ It is added as the Attribute to the HTML element in the opening tag --> class=""
+ You can have more than one class per HTML element and class names can be used on more than one HTML element
+ Multiple class names example: <p class="ovojeprvaklasa ovojedrugaklasa">
+ Class is accessed in CSS by .nameoftheclass{}

++Very Important Attribute that is added to elements for identifying them is called "id":
+ It is added as the Attribute to the HTML element in the opening tag --> id=""
+ You can only have one class per HTML element and that id name can not be used anywhere else
+ ID is accessed in CSS by #nameoftheid{}

Pseudo classes --> :hover 

HTML elements:
<!-- Comment -->
+ <h1> </h1> -- <h6> </h6> --> Heading Element 1 largest / 6 smallest
+ <p> </p> --> adds a paragraph
+ <br> --> break, moves to the next line
+ <hr> --> similar to a break but it creates a greater break between the texts that is represented with a line
+ <i> </i> --> Italic
+ <em> </em> --> Italic but adds the "emphasis" to the text, <i> only visually styles it while <em> adds additional information
+ <b> </b> --> Bold
+ <strong> </strong> --> Same relationship between <b> and <strong> as between <i> and <em> 
<!-- <em> and <strong> should be used -->
+<ul> </ul> --> unordered list, ordered with dots
+<ol> </ol> --> ordered list, ordered with different styles - "style" attribute
+<img> --> adds an image, it is fully dependable of attributes - src= the source of an image; alt= alternative text to display if image is not shown
+<a> </a> --> anchor tag, hypertext - important attribute href= hypertextreference basically value will tell the browser where to send user on press
one more important attribute of <a> is target=_blank - opens the link in the new tab!
Table: <table> </table> - creates a table element, <thead> </thead> , <tbody> </tbody>, <tfoot> </tfoot>, header of a table, body of a table and
footer of a table.
<tr> </tr> --> creates a table row, horizontal line
<td> </td> --> table data adds a cell of information to the table row, it is set inside the <tr> element 
<thead> </thead> --> header of a table and by deafult it is bolded, basicaly creating a row in a table that is set as a main head of a table instead
of using <td> to cretes and fill table cells in the table for <thead> the <th> is used, we can use <th> on its own but it is a good practice to put it in
<thead> element.
<form> </form> --> The HTML <form> element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.
Form does not use h1 or p for text, in a form developer uses label
<label> </label> --> between it developer writes "Username" for an example or "Password"
<input> (self-closing tag) --> creates a box for user to input data inside of the form, input has important attribute called "type" where you specify what kind
of data is expected in that box
<textarea> </textarea>	
<span> </span> --> HTML element that does not do much if its not edited with css, it acts as a container

++ Divs ++
This div is a special HTML element that allows us to divide our content up on our web site so that we can structure each div separately. 
So essentially a div stands for a content division element and it basically allows you to split up or divide your content into separate containers or boxes 
so that you can affect the layout of each box separately.

++FaviCons++
Icon added to the tab of the website, in the HTML <head> element <link> element is added rel (relation) changed to "icon" and href to the destination
of the icon itself. 
favicon.cc


HTML tags' Attributes:
-Attributes are used inside the HTML tags to add additional information about the style of a tag itself, what attributes do tags have can be found in
the documentation.
